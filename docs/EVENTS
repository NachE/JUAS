/*
You can suscribe to events dispatched by the application when
certain actions happen.
To suscribe you just need to know the event name and then
use the addEventListener method of EventBus.
Keep reading for examples and a list of events.
*/



/*
Suscribe to an event.
event_name is a string containing the name of the event to
which you want to listen.
function can be the name of a function (not a string but the
actual name) or an anonymous function, you choose.
*/
EventBus.addEventListener(event_name, function);



/*
window_resize_start is dispatched when the window starts being
resized.
*/



/*
window_resize is dispatched every time the window is resized.
Note that you could get hundreds of that event in between
window_resize_start and window_resize_stop.
*/



/*
window_resize_stop is dispatched when the window stops 
resizing.
*/



/*
window_minimize is dispatched when the window is minimized.
*/



/*
window_maximize is dispatched when the window is maximized.
*/



/*
window_drag is dispatched every time the window changes it's 
position because of a drag caused by the mouse.
*/



/*
app_quit is launched when the close button is clicked.
Note that if you don't listen to that event, the application
does exactly what you expect it to do: quit.
Anyways, if you do listen for that event then the application
wont quit but just dispatch the app_quit event. That way you're
able to do whatever you want before quitting the application.
That means that you'll need to quit the application yourself
using the quit method of App.
