JUAS - Javascript Unified Applications Superengine
===

Platform for creating Javascript desktop applications (HTML5/CSS3 for the UI)

Yes, I know, the name ROCKS! Or maybe not. Anyways, it's just a joke-name
I decided to use after tons of LOLs while brainstorming for a name with friends.
Despite the name being a complete joke, the project itself is serious. 

JUAS will let you build Javascript / HTML5 / CSS3 desktop applications.
Also, the project is based on Qt5 so you'll automatically gain multiOS support.

I'll try to document all and every single (important and public) method.
Please check the docs folder for documentation on different parts of the
application itself.

PS: You'll want to set your editor's syntax to 'JavaScript'.
